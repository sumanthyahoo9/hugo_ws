   - Intended for studying surgical robotics concepts, forward/inverse kinematics, and motion planning
   - Used to learn ROS2 workspace management, URDF modeling, and simulation frameworks
   - Not intended for commercial use, medical applications, or clinical deployment

3. **No Medical Application**:
   - This simulation is NOT validated for medical use
   - NOT suitable for surgical planning, training, or patient care
   - No claims of accuracy for real-world surgical applications
